\section{Basic Notions of Rings}
\subsection{Radical Ideals}
\begin{defn}{Radical of an Ideal}{} Let $I$ be an ideal of a ring $R$. Define the radical of $I$ to be $$\sqrt{I}=\{r\in R|r^n\in I\text{ for some }n\in\N\}$$
We say that an ideal is radical if $\sqrt{I}=I$. 
\end{defn}

\subsection{Nilradical and Jacobson Ideals}
Recall that we say an element $r\in R$ is nilpotent if there is some $n\in\N$ such that $r^n=0$. 

\begin{defn}{Nilradicals}{} Let $R$ be a ring. Define the nilradical of $R$ to be $$N(R)=\{r\in R|r\text{ is nilpotent }\}$$
\end{defn}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $R$ be a ring and $N(R)$ its nilradical. Then the following are true. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $N(R)$ is an ideal of $R$
\item $N(R/N(R))=0$
\end{itemize}\tcbline
\begin{proof}~\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose that $r,s$ are nilpotent, meaning that $r^n=0$ and $s^m=0$. Then $(r+s)^{n+m}=0$. Moreover, if $t\in R$ then $t\cdot r$ is also nilpotent
\item Let $r\notin N(R)$. Every element $r+N(R)\in R/N(R)$ has the property that $r^n\neq 0$. Consider $(r+N(R))^n=r^n+N(R)$. If $r^n\in N(R)$ then $r^n=u$ for some nilpotent $u$, which means that $r^n$ is nilpotent and thus $r$ is nilpotent, a contradiction. This means that $r+N(R)\notin N(R/N(R))$ for all $r\notin N(R)$ and thus $N(R/N(R))=0$
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\end{prp}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $R$ be a commutative ring. The nilradical of $R$ is the intersection of all prime ideals of $R$. \tcbline
\begin{proof}
We want to show that $$N(R)=\bigcap_{\substack{P\text{ a prime}\\\text{ideal of }R}}P$$
Trivially $N(R)$ is a prime ideal. Now suppose that $r\in R$ is in the intersection of all prime ideals. Then $r^n$ also lies in every prime ideal. 
\end{proof}
\end{prp}

\begin{defn}{Jacobson Radical of a Ring}{} Let $R$ be a ring. Define the Jacobson radical of $R$ to be $$J(R)=\bigcap_{\substack{M\text{ is a}\\\text{maximal ideal}\\\text{of }R}}M$$
\end{defn}

\section{Basic Notions of Modules}
\subsection{Nakayama's Lemma}
\begin{lmm}{Nakayama's Lemma}{} Let $R$ be a ring and $I$ an ideal of $R$. Let $M$ be a finitely generated $R$-module. If $IM=M$ then there exists $r\in R$ with $r\equiv 1\;(\bmod\;I)$ such that $rM=0$. 
\end{lmm}

\begin{lmm}{}{} Let $R$ be a local ring with maximal ideal $m$. Let $M$ be a finitely generated $R$-module. If $M=mM$, then $M=0$. 
\end{lmm}

\begin{lmm}{}{} Let $R$ be a local ring with maximal ideal $m$. Let $M$ be a finitely generated $R$-module. Let $a_1,\dots,a_n\in M$ such that $a_1+mM,\dots,a_n+mM$ spans $M/mM$ as a vector space over $R/m$. Then $a_1,\dots,a_n$ generate $M$. 
\end{lmm}

\section{Localization}
\subsection{Localization of a Ring}
\begin{defn}{Multiplicative Set}{} Let $R$ be a commutative ring. $S\subseteq R$ is a multiplicative set if $1\in S$ and $S$ is closed under multiplication: $x,y\in S$ implies $xy\in S$
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Localization of a Ring}{} Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $S\subseteq R$ be a multiplicative set. Define the ring of fractions of $R$ with respect to $S$ by $$S^{-1}R=\left\{\frac{r}{s}|r\in R,s\in S\right\}/\sim$$ where $\sim$ is defined by $$\frac{r}{s}\sim\frac{r'}{s'}\text{ if and only if }\exists v\in S\text{ such that }v(ru'-r'u)=0$$
If $S=\{1,f,f^2,\dots\}$ then we write $S^{-1}R=R_f=R[1/f]$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $S^{-1}R$ be a ring of fractions. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\sim$ as defined in the ring of fractions is an equivalence relation
\item $(S^{-1}R,+,\times)$ is a ring
\item The map $\phi:R\to S^{-1}R$ defined by $\phi(r)\to\frac{r}{1}$ is a ring homomorphism
\end{itemize}\tcbline
\begin{proof}~\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Trivial
\item Define addition by $\frac{r}{s}+\frac{r'}{s'}=\frac{rs'+r's}{ss'}$ and multiplication by $\frac{r}{s}\cdot\frac{r'}{s'}=\frac{rr'}{ss'}$. Clearly addition is abelian, and has identity $\frac{0}{1}$ and inverse $\frac{-r}{s}$ for any $\frac{r}{s}\in S^{-1}R$. Multiplication also has identity $\frac{1}{1}$. 
\item We have that $\phi(r+s)=\frac{r+s}{1}=\frac{r}{1}+\frac{s}{1}=\phi(r)+\phi(s)$ and $\phi(rs)=\frac{rs}{1}=\frac{r}{1}\cdot\frac{s}{1}=\phi(r)\cdot\phi(s)$ for any $r,s\in R$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\end{prp}

\begin{thm}{Universal Property}{} Let $g:A\to B$ be a ring homomorphism such that $g(s)$ is a unit in $B$ for all $s\in S$. Then there exists a unique ring homomorphism $h:S^{-1}A\to B$ such that $g=h\circ\phi$. In other words, the following diagram commutes: \\~\\
\adjustbox{scale=1.1,center}{\begin{tikzcd}
A\arrow[r, "\phi"]\arrow[rd, "g"] & S^{-1}A\arrow[d, "\exists!h", dashed]\\
&B
\end{tikzcd}}
\end{thm}

\subsection{Localization at a Prime Ideal}
\begin{lmm}{}{} Let $R$ be a ring and $P$ a prime ideal of $R$. Then $R\setminus P$ is a multiplicative set. \tcbline
\begin{proof}
By definition, $xy\in P$ implies $x\in P$ or $y\in P$, since $R\setminus P$ removes all these elements, we have that $x\notin P$ and $y\notin P$ implies that $xy\notin P$. 
\end{proof}
\end{lmm}

\begin{defn}{Localization on Prime Ideals}{} Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Let $P$ be a prime ideal. Denote $$R_p=(R\setminus P)^{-1}R$$ the localization of $R$ at $P$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{lmm}{}{} Let $R$ be an integral domain. Then the localization $$(R\setminus(0))^{-1}R$$ is exactly the field of fractions of $R$. 
\end{lmm}

\subsection{Properties of Localization}
\begin{prp}{}{} Localization commutes with direct sum of modules and quotient modules. 
\end{prp}

\subsection{Local Rings}
\begin{defn}{Local Rings}{} A ring $R$ is said to be a local ring if it has a unique maximal ideal $m$. In this case, we say that $R/m$ is the residue field of $R$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $R$ be a ring and $I$ an ideal of $R$. Then $I$ is the unique maximal ideal of $R$ if and only if $I$ is the set containing all non-units of $R$. \tcbline
\begin{proof}
Let $I$ be the unique maximal ideal of $R$. Clearly $I$ does not contain any unit else $I=R$. Now suppose that $r$ is a non-unit. Suppose that $r\notin I$. Define $J=\{sr|s\in R\}$ Clearly $J$ is an ideal. It must be contained in some maximal ideal. Since $I$ is the unique maximal ideal, $J\subseteq I$. But this means that $r\in I$, a contradiction. Thus every non-unit is in $I$. \\~\\
Suppose that $I$ contains all non-units of $R$. Let $r\notin I$. Then there exists $s\notin I$ such that $rs=1$. Then $(r+I)(s+I)=1+I$ in $R/I$. This means that every element of $R/I$ has a multiplicative inverse which means that $R/I$ is a field and thus $I$ is a maximal ideal. Now let $J\neq I$ be another maximal ideal. Then $J$ contains some unit $r$. This implies that $J=R$ and thus $I$ is the unique maximal ideal. 
\end{proof}
\end{prp}

\begin{prp}{}{} Every localization $R_p$ is a local ring. \tcbline
\begin{proof}
Let $I$ be the set of all non-units of $R_p$. It is sufficient to show that $I$ is an ideal by the above lemma. Clearly if $i\in I$ then $r\cdot i$ is also not invertible. Explicitly, we have $$I=\left\{\frac{r}{s}\in R_p\bigg{|}r\in p\right\}$$ Let $\frac{r_1}{s_1},\frac{r_2}{s_2}\in I$, then $\frac{r_1}{s_1}+\frac{r_2}{s_2}=\frac{r_1s_2+r_2s_1}{s_1s_2}$ is in $I$ since $r_1,r_2\in P$ and $P$ being an ideal implies $r_1s_2+r_2s_1\in P$. 
\end{proof}
\end{prp}

Be wary that in general localizations does not result in a local ring. This happens only when we are localizing with respect to a prime ideal. The importance of prime ideals is not explicit in the above because only using prime ideals $P$ can $R\setminus P$ be a multiplicative set which ultimately allows localization to make sense. 

\subsection{Localization of a Module}
\begin{defn}{Localization of a Module}{} Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $S\subseteq R$ be a multiplicative set Let $M$ be a $R$-module. Define the ring of fractions of $M$ with respect to $S$ by $$S^{-1}M=\left\{\frac{m}{s}|m\in M,s\in S\right\}/\sim$$ where $\sim$ is defined by $$\frac{m}{s}\sim\frac{m'}{s'}\text{ if and only if }\exists v\in S\text{ such that }v(mu'-m'u)=0$$
If $S=\{1,f,f^2,\dots\}$ then we write $S^{-1}M=M_f=M[1/f]$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $S$ be a multiplicative set of a ring $R$. Then localization at $S$ preservers exact sequences. 
\end{prp}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $M$ be an $A$-module. Then the $S^{-1}A$ modules $S^{-1}M$ is isomorphic to $S^{-1}A\otimes_AM$. More precisely, there exists a unique isomorphism $f:S^{-1}A\otimes_AM\to S^{-1}M$ such that $$f((a/s)\otimes m)=am/s$$
\end{prp}

\subsection{Local Properties}
\begin{defn}{Local Properties}{} A property $P$ of a ring $A$ or of an $A$-module $M$ is said to be a local property if the following is true. $A$ ($M$) has the property $P$ if and only if $A_p$ ($M_p$) has the property $P$ for every prime ideal $p$.
\end{defn}

\section{Noetherian Rings}
\subsection{Ordering on the Monomials}
Recall that a monomial in $R[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is an element in the polynomial ring of the form $x_1^{a_1}\cdots x_n^{a_n}$. For simplicity we write this as $x^{(a_1,\dots,a_n)}$. 

\begin{defn}{Monomial Ordering}{} A monomial ordering on a polynomial ring $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is a relation $>$ on $\N^n$. This means that the following are true. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $>$ is a total ordering on $\N^n$
\item If $a>b$ and $c\in\N^n$ then $a+c>b+c$
\item $>$ is a well ordering on $\N^n$ (any nonempty subset of $\N^n$ has a smallest element)
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Lexicographical Order}{} Let $a=(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ and $b=(b_1,\dots,b_n)$ in $\N^n$. We say that $a>_{\text{lex}}b$ if in the first nonzero entry of $a-b$ is positive. 
\end{defn}

In practise this means that the we value more powers of $x_1$

\begin{defn}{Graded Lex Order}{} Let $a=(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ and $b=(b_1,\dots,b_n)$ in $\N^n$. We say that $a>_{\text{grlex}}b$ if either of the following holds. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\abs{a}=\sum_{k=1}^na_k>\sum_{k=1}^nb_k=\abs{b}$
\item $\abs{a}=\abs{b}$ and $a>_{\text{lex}}b$
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Graded Lex Order}{} Let $a=(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ and $b=(b_1,\dots,b_n)$ in $\N^n$. We say that $a>_{\text{grlex}}b$ if either of the following holds. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\abs{a}=\sum_{k=1}^na_k>\sum_{k=1}^nb_k=\abs{b}$
\item $\abs{a}=\abs{b}$ and the last nonzero entry of $a-b$ is negative. 
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

In practise we value lower powers of the last variable $x_n$. 

\begin{prp}{}{} The above three orders are all monomial orderings of $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. 
\end{prp}

\begin{defn}{Multidegree}{} Let $f\in k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ be a polynomial in the form $f=\sum_{v\in\N^n}c_vx^v$. Define the multidegree of $f$ to be $$\text{multideg}(f)=\max_>\{v\in\N^n|a_v\neq 0\}$$ where $>$ is a monomial ordering on $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Leading Objects}{} Let $f\in k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ be a polynomial in the form $f=\sum_{v\in\N^n}c_vx^v$. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Define the leading coefficient of $f$ to be $\text{LC}(f)=c_\text{multideg(f)}\in k$
\item Define the leading monomial of $f$ to be $\text{LM}(f)=c_\text{multideg(f)}\in k$
\item Define the leading term of $f$ to be $\text{LT}=\text{LC}(f)\cdot\text{LM}(f)$
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{prp}{Division Algorithm in $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$}{}
\end{prp}

\subsection{Monomial Ideals}
\begin{defn}{Monomial Ideals}{} An ideal $I\subset k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is said to be a monomial ideal if $I$ is generated by a set of monomials $\{x^v|v\in A\}$ for some $A\subset\N^n$. In this case we write $$I=\langle x^v|v\in A\rangle$$
\end{defn}

\begin{lmm}{}{} Let $I=\langle x^v|v\in A\rangle$ be an ideal of $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. Then a monomial $x^w$ lies in $I$ if and only if $x^v|x^w$ for some $v\in A$. Moreover, if $f=\sum_{w\in\N^n}c_wx^w\in k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ lies in $I$, then each $x^w$ is divisible by $x^v$ for some $v\in A$. 
\end{lmm}

\begin{thm}{Dickson's Lemma}{} Every monomial ideal is finitely generated. In particular, every monomial ideal $I=\langle x^v|v\in A\rangle$ is of the form $$I=\langle x^{v_1},\dots,x^{v_n}\rangle$$ where $v_1,\dots,v_n\in A$. 
\end{thm}

\subsection{Groebner Bases}

\subsection{Noetherian Rings}
\begin{defn}{Noetherian Ring}{} A commutative ring is said to be Noetherian if it satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals. Meaning if every chain oif ideals $I_0\subseteq I_1\subseteq I_2\subseteq\dots$ is eventually constant for some $n\in\N$, with $I_n=I_{n+1}=I_{n+2}=\dots$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prp}{}{} The following are equivalent for a ring $R$. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $R$ is a Noetherian ring
\item Every ideal in $R$ is finitely generated
\item Every nonempty set of ideal has a maximal element. 
\end{itemize}
\end{prp}

\begin{prp}{}{} If $A$ is a Noetherian and $\phi$ is a homomorphism of $A$ onto a ring $B$, then $B$ is Noetherian. 
\end{prp}

\begin{thm}{Hilbert's Basis Theorem}{} If $R$ is a Noetherian ring, then $R[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is a Noetherian ring. 
\end{thm}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring and $I$ be an ideal in $R$. Then $R/I$ is Noetherian. 
\end{prp}

\section{Primary Decomposition}
\subsection{Support of a Module}
\begin{defn}{Support of a Module}{} Let $M$ be an $A$-module. The support of $M$ is the subset $$\text{Supp}(M)=\{P\text{ a prime ideal of }A|M_P\neq 0\}$$
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Annihilator}{} Let $M$ be an $A$-module. Let $m\in M$. Define the annihilator of $m$ to be $$\text{Ann}(m)=\{f\in A|fm=0\}$$ Also define the annihilator of $M$ to be $$\text{Ann}(M)=\{f\in A|fM=0\}$$
\end{defn}

\subsection{Associated Prime}
\begin{defn}{Associated Prime}{} Let $M$ be an $A$-module. An associated prime $P$ of $M$ is a prime ideal of $A$ such that there exists some $m\in M$ such that $P=\text{Ann}(m)$. 
\end{defn}

\subsection{Primary Ideals}
\begin{defn}{Primary Ideals}{} Let $R$ be a ring. An ideal $Q$ of $R$ is called primary if
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q\neq R$
\item $fg\in Q$ implies $f\in Q$ or $g^m\in Q$ for some $m>0$
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{lmm}{}{} If $Q$ is primary, then $\sqrt{Q}$ is prime. 
\end{lmm}

\begin{lmm}{}{} Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring and $I$ be a proper ideal that is not primary. Then $$I=J_1\cap J_2$$ for some ideals $J_1,J_2\neq I$. 
\end{lmm}

\begin{defn}{P-Primary Ideals}{} Let $A$ be a ring and $P$ a prime ideal. An ideal $Q$ is $P$-primary if $Q$ is primary and $Q=\text{rad}(P)$
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}{}{} Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and $Q$ an ideal of $A$. Then $Q$ is $P$-primary if and only if $\text{Ann}(A/Q)=\{P\}$. 
\end{thm}

\subsection{Primary Decomposition}
We want to express ideal $I$ in $R$ as $I=P_1^{e_1}\cdots P_n^{e_n}$ similar to a factorization of natural numbers, for some prime ideals $P_1,\dots,P_n$. However this notion fails and thus we have the following new type of ideal. 

\begin{defn}{Primary Decompositions}{} A primary decomposition of an ideal $I$ is an expression $I=Q_1\cap\dots\cap Q_r$ with each $Q_i$ primary. \\~\\
The decomposition is said to be irredundant if $I\neq\cap_{i\neq j}Q_i$ for any $j$. The decomposition is said to be minimal if $r$ is the smallest possible such decomposition for $I$. 
\end{defn}

Irredundant in this sense means that removing any one primary ideal in the intersection fails to become a decomposition of $I$. 

\begin{thm}{}{} Every proper ideal in a Noetherian ring has a primary decomposition. 
\end{thm}

\begin{lmm}{}{} Let $\phi:R\to S$ be a ring homomorphism and $Q$ be a primary ideal in $S$. Then $\phi^{-1}(Q)$ is primary in $R$. 
\end{lmm}

\section{Integral Dependence}
\subsection{Integral Extensions}
\begin{defn}{Integral Elements}{} Let $B$ be a ring and let $A\subseteq B$ be a subring. Let $b\in B$. We say that $b$ is integral over $A$ if there exists a monic polynomial $p(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_0\in A[x]$ such that $p(b)=0$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $B$ be a ring and let $A\subseteq B$. Let $b\in B$. Then the following are equivalent. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $b$ is integral over $A$
\item The subring $A[b]\subseteq B$ is finite over $A$
\item There exists an $A$ sub-algebra $A'\subseteq B$ such that $A[b]\subseteq A'$ and $A'$ is finite over $A$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{prp}

\begin{defn}{Integral Closure}{} Let $B$ be an $A$-algebra. Define the subring $$\tilde{A}=\{b\in B|b\text{ is integral over }A\}$$ to be the integral closure of $A$ in $B$. If $\tilde{A}=A$, then we say that $A$ is integrally closed in $B$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Normal Domains}{} Let $R$ be a domain. We say that $R$ is normal (intergrally closed) if $A$ is integrally closed in its field of fractions. \\~\\
The integral closure of $R$ in $\text{Frac}(R)$ is called the normalization of $R$. 
\end{defn}

\section{Discrete Valuation Rings}
\subsection{Discrete Valuation Rings}
\begin{defn}{Totally Ordered Group}{} A totally ordered group is a group $G$ with a total order "$\leq$" such that it is
\begin{itemize}
\item a left ordered group: $a\leq b$ implies $ca\leq cb$ for all $a,b,c\in G$
\item a right ordered group: $a\leq b$ implies $ac\leq bc$ for all $a,b,c\in G$
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Valuation on a Field}{} Let $K$ be a field. Let $G$ be a totally ordered abelian group. A valuation on $K$ with values in $G$ is a map $v:K\setminus\{0\}\to G$ such that for all $x,y\in K^\ast$, we have 
\begin{itemize}
\item $v(xy)=v(x)+v(y)$
\item $v(x+y)\geq\min\{v(x),v(y)\}$
\end{itemize}
We use the convention that $v(0)=\infty$. \\~\\
$v$ is said to be a discrete valuation if $G=\Z$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $K$ be a field and $v:K\to\Z$ a discrete valuation. Then $$\{x\in K|v(x)\geq 0\}$$ is a subring of $K$. 
\end{prp}

\begin{defn}{Discrete Valuation Rings}{} The discrete valuation ring of a discrete valuation $v:K\to\Z$ is the subset $$A=\{x\in K|v(x)\geq 0\}$$
Alternatively, any ring isomorphic to a discrete valuation ring of some discrete valuation is also called a discrete valuation. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $R$ be a discrete valuation ring with respect to the valuation $v$. Let $t\in R$ be such that $v(t)=1$. Then the following are true. 
\begin{itemize}
\item A nonzero element $u\in R$ is a unit if and only if $v(u)=0$
\item Every non-zero ideal of $R$ is a principal ideal of the form $(t^n)$ for some $n\geq 0$
\item Every $r\in R\setminus\{0\}$ can be written in the form $r=ut^n$ for some unit $u$ and $n\geq 0$. 
\end{itemize}\tcbline
\begin{proof}~\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $R$ be a discrete valuation ring. Suppose that $x\in R$ is a unit. Then $v(x^{-1})=-v(x)$. Then $-v(x),v(x)\geq 0$ implies $v(x)=0$. Now if $v(y)>0$ , suppose for contradiction that $u\in R$ is an inverse of $y$, then $$0=v(1)=v(uy)=v(u)+v(y)$$ But $v(y)>0$ implies that $v(u)<0$ which implies that $u\notin R$, a contradiction. 
\item Let $t\in R$ such that $v(t)=1$. Let $x\in m$ where $v(x)=n>0$. Then $v(x)=nv(t)=v(t^n)$ means that every $x\in m$ is of the form $t^n$. Thus $m=(t)$. Since every ideal $I$ is a subset of this maximal ideal, any ideal is of the form $I=(t^n)$ for some $n>0$. 
\item Follows from the fact that $(t^n)$ is the unique maximal ideal. 
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\end{prp}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $R$ be an integral domain. Then the following are equivalent. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $R$ is a discrete valuation ring
\item $R$ is a UFD with a unique irreducible element up to multiplication of a unit
\item $R$ is a Noetherian local ring with a principal maximal ideal
\end{itemize} \tcbline
\begin{proof}~\\
\begin{itemize}
\item $(1)\implies(3)$: We have seen that the set of non-units is precisely the set $m=\{x\in K|v(x)>0\}$. We show that this is an ideal. Clearly $x,y\in m$ implies $v(x+y)=\min\{v(x),v(y)\}>0$. Let $u\in R$. Then $v(ux)=v(u)+v(x)>0$ since $v(x)>0$ and $v(u)\geq 0$. \\~\\
We have seen that every ideal is of the form $(t^n)$ for some $n>0$. Thus every ascending chains of ideal must be of the form $$(t^{n_1})\subset(t^{n_2})\subset\dots$$ for $n_1>n_2>\dots$. Since $n_1,n_2,\dots$ is strictly decreasing, the chain must eventually stabilizes. This proves that $R$ is Noetherian and has principal maximal ideal. 
\item $(1)\implies(3)$:
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
