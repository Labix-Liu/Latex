\begin{abstract}
Geometry is one of the oldest topics in mathematics. Almost every topic in mathematics has its origin from Geometry and a lot of mathematicians have somewhat been involved int development. In these notes note we study geometry with a bit of algebraic flavour in it, instead of dealing with axiomatic geometry.
