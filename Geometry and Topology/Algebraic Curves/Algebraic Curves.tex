\section{Algebraic Curves in Classical Algebraic Geometry}
\subsection{Basic Properties of Curves}
\begin{defn}{Curves}{} Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$ be a variety over $k$. We say that $X$ is a curve if $\dim(X)=1$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Let $C$ be an irreducible curve over $k$. Let $p\in C$ be a non-singular point. Then $\mO_{C,p}$ is a DVR. Moreover, the valuation is given by the degree of the regular function. \tcbline
\begin{proof}
Since $p$ is non-singular, by definition $\mO_{C,p}$ is a regular local ring. Moreover, we know that $1=\dim(C)=\dim(\mO_{C,p})$ so that $\mO_{C,p}$ has Krull dimension $1$. By the equivalent characterization of DVR we conclude. 
\end{proof}
\end{prp}

\begin{eg}{}{} Consider the projective curve $C=\V(x^2+y^2-z^2)\subset\Prj_\C^2$. Let $p=[p_0:p_1:p_2]$ be a point on the curve. \\~\\

If $p_2\neq 0$, then $p\in U_2$. Under the affine chart $(U_2,\varphi_2)$, we find that $C_2=\varphi_2(C\cap U_2)=\V(x^2+y^2-1)$. The corresponding coordinate ring is given by $\frac{\C[x,y]}{(x^2+y^2-1)}$. The formula for the local ring in the affine case gives $$\mO_{C,p}\cong\left(\frac{\C[x,y]}{(x^2+y^2-1)}\right)_{m_{(p_0/p_2,p_1/p_2)}}$$ Recall that the unique maximal ideal of the local ring is given as the $\mO_{X,p}$-module $m_p=\{f\in\C[C_2]\;|\;f(p_0/p_2,p_1/p_2)=0\}$, which under the nullstellensatz is the maximal ideal corresponding to the point $(p_0/p_2,p_1/p_2)$ and is given by $m_p=(x-r,y-s)$ where $r=p_0/p_1$ and $s=p_0/p_2$. By Nakayama's lemma, since $x-r,y-s$ generate $m_p$ we know that $x-r+m_p^2,y-s+m_p^2$ span the vector space $m_p/m_p^2$ over $\mO_{X,p}/m_p$. I claim that they are linearly dependent. This mean that I want to find $f+m_p^2$ and $g+m_p^2$ in $\mO_{X,p}/m_p$ that are non-trivial, and that $(x-r)f+(y-s)g+m_p^2=m_p^2$. This means that we want to find $f,g\in\mO_{X,p}\setminus m_p$ such that $(x-r)f+(y-s)g\in m_p^2$. Choose $f=x+r$ and $g=y+s$ to get $$(x-r)(x+r)+(y-s)(y+s)=x^2-r^2+y^2-s^2=1-1=0$$ since $(r,s)$ lie on the curve. Moreover, $x+r,y+s\mO_{X,p}\setminus m_p$ since evaluating at $(r,s)$ at the functions are non-zero. This verifies that $\mO_{X,p}$ is a regular local ring of dimension $1$, hence is a DVR. \\~\\

We can even find its uniformizer and valuation. Since $x-r$ and $y+s$ are linearly dependent and spans $m_p/m_p^2$, any one of the two is a basis for the vector space. WLOG take $x-r$ to be a basis. Nakayama's lemma implies that $x-r$ generates $m_p$. Being a DVR means that for all $f\in\mO_{X,p}$, $f=u(x-r)^n$ where $u$ is invertible. Then the valuation of $f$ is $n$. 
\end{eg}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $C$ be an affine irreducible curve over $\C$. Then $C$ is smooth if and only if $C$ is a normal variety. 
\end{prp}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $k$ be a field. Let $C$ be a smooth curve over $k$. Then for any projective variety $X\subseteq\Prj^n$ and rational map $\phi:C\to X$, there exists a regular map $$\overline{\phi}:C\to X$$ such that $\overline{\phi}|_U=\phi|_U$ for some dense subset $U\subseteq C$. 
\end{prp}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Let $X,Y$ be smooth irreducible projective curves over $k$. Let $\phi:X\to Y$ be a non-constant regular map. Then $\phi$ is a finite morphism. 
\end{prp}

\subsection{Blowing Up Curves and Normalization}
Recall that by taking the integral closure of the coordinate ring $k[C]$ of an irreducible affine curve $C\subseteq\A^n$, we obtain a corresponding variety $\widetilde{C}$ called the normalization of $C$. 

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Let $C\subseteq\A_k^n$ be an irreducible affine curve over $k$. Then the normalization $\widetilde{C}$ is smooth. 
\end{prp}

\begin{thm}{}{} Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Let $C$ be an irreducible curve over $k$. Then $C$ is birational to a unique non-singular projective irreducible curve. 
\end{thm}

\section{Algebraic Curves in the Context of Schemes}
\begin{defn}{Algebraic Curves}{} Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. A curve over $k$ is an integral separated scheme $X$ of finite type over $k$ that has dimension $1$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prp}{}{} Let $X$ be an algebraic curve. Then the arithmetic and geometric genus coincide. In particular, $$p_a(X)=p_g(X)=\dim_kH^1(X,\mO_X)$$
\end{prp}

We will simply call the genus of a curve $g$ from now on since the arithmetic genus is the same as the geometric genus. 

\subsection{Riemann-Roch Theorem}
\begin{defn}{Canonical Divisor}{} Let $X$ be an algebraic curve. The canonical divisor $K$ of $X$ is a divisor in the linear equivalence class of $$\Omega_{X/k}^1=\omega_X$$
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}{Riemann-Roch Theorem}{} Let $X$ be an algebraic curve. Let $D$ be a divisor on $X$ and let $K$ be the canonical divisor of $X$. Let $\mL(D)$ be the associated sheaf of the divisor $D$. Then $$\dim_k(H^0(X,\mL(D)))+\dim_k(H^0(X,\mL(K-D)))=\deg(D)+1-p_g(X)$$
\end{thm}
